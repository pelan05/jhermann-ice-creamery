> *Unsweetened* pre-mixed stabilizer for Ninja Creami recipes.

It takes handling small amounts of ingredients and their ratio to each other
out of the process of mixing your final ice cream base,
making the overall process less finicky.

To prepare the mix, take a **BIG** bowl like used for baking, measure the ingredients on a scale,
and whisk them carefully but thoroughly. A ball whisk works best.
When done, store the powder in an air-tight container with enough volume.

To get an even mix, progressively add the inulin, i.e. start with only 30g of inulin,
mix with all other ingredients,
then add more and more inulin while mixing, until you reach the target weight.

> **3 Ingredient Replacement**<br />In a pinch, you can replace one 15g dose of the mix by 1.5g guar, 0.5g xanthan, and 0.5g salt — scale other amounts accordingly.
> Do not expect the exact same results as from the full blend.
>
> **GMS Availability**<br />If you cannot source pure GMS, using products that fall into the general *Mono- and Diglycerides of Fatty Acids* (E471)
> category, which GMS belongs to, can be a viable alternative. Or use soy or sunflower lecithin — the recommended dose is 0.1% to 0.5%,
> and the recipe's 18g are equivalent to about 0.26% in an ice cream base.

Adding bulk to the thickeners prevents clumping when blending them into your base.
Drizzle the mix into the vortex of a running blender,
or drop it into your mixing container and quickly integrate it with an immersion blender on full speed.
Before that, combine this mix with any granulated sweetener or other dry / powdery ingredients you have.

Use 15g of the mix for a Creami Deluxe tub (24oz, yields 10),
and 10g for the regular size (16oz, yields 15).

For optimal results regarding texture and ice crystal prevention, heat suitable parts of the liquids
in your recipe (e.g. the milk, at least 200ml or so) to somewhere between 50°C and 80°C, and
blend the mix plus other dry ingredients into the hot liquid. This improves hydration of gums,
dissolves your sugars, and activates the emulsifier.

The salt is added for convenience with final recipes,
and for a FPDF boost. Inulin bulks up the mix to be compatible with normal kitchen scales.
